<p>This page lists my seminars, conference presentations, lectures, etc. reverse-chronologically. It is primarily intended for my own record, but it may also be useful for cost-sharing if you would like to invite me for a talk in the future at a nearby place. You can also infer the projects I have most interest, suffered from long reviews, procrastinated, or abandoned.</p>
