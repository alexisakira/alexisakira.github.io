Alexis Akira Toda (pronounced `Alexy Akira Toda`) was born in [Montréal, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal) to a Japanese father and a French-Canadian mother and moved to Japan at the age of four. He received a B.A. in medicine from [University of Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tokyo) in 2004 and then an M.A. in economics in 2008 while practicing anesthesia. He moved to the United States in 2008 and obtained a Ph.D. in economics from [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University) in 2013. After teaching mathematics for economics, mathematical economics, and finance at [UC San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego) for eleven years, he moved to [Emory University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University) in 2024. He is the author of more than 50 research articles published in economics, mathematics, physics, and medical journals on a wide variety of topics, including general equilibrium, macro-finance, consumption and savings, income and wealth distributions, asset price bubbles, power laws, dynamic programming, econometrics, and numerical methods, among others. According to [WikiTree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Toda-2), he is a distant cousin of [Celine Dion](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:Relationship&action=calculate&person1Name=Toda-2&person2Name=Dion-75) (singer), [Justin Trudeau](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:Relationship&action=calculate&person1Name=Toda-2&person2Name=Trudeau-195) (former Prime Minister of Canada), and [Taylor Swift](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:Relationship&action=calculate&person1Name=Toda-2&person2Name=Swift-1298) (singer).

## My research
I am a mathematical economist with strong interests in applications, in particular macroeconomics and finance. The topics I have worked on include

- [necessity of asset price bubbles](https://doi.org/10.1086/732528),
- [computational algorithm for solving macroeconomic models with realistic wealth distributions](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE1817),
- [simple formula and mathematical foundation for Pareto exponents that arise in random multiplicative processes in Markovian environments](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA17984),
- [optimal epidemic control when testing and government enforcement are imperfect](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2022.105570),
- [simple explanation for the saving behavior of the rich that does not rely on ad hoc utility functions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2021.105193),
- [verification of the random multiplicative process to explain the spread of COVID-19](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physd.2020.132649),
- [wealth inequality and stock market returns](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhz121),
- [determination of academic salaries](https://econjwatch.org/articles/publications-citations-position-and-compensation-of-economics-professors),
- [implication of financial development to international capital flows and welfare](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.08.011),
- [impossibility of canonical macroeconomic models to explain wealth inequality](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2019.04.001),
- [efficient discretization of non-linear, non-Gaussian Markov processes](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE737),

among others.

I have published papers in journals such as [Econometrica](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680262), [Journal of Political Economy](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/jpe/current), [Theoretical Economics](https://econtheory.org/), [Quantitative Economics](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/quantitative-economics), [Journal of Economic Theory](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-economic-theory), [Review of Financial Studies](https://academic.oup.com/rfs), [Journal of Financial Economics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-financial-economics), [Journal of Monetary Economics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-monetary-economics), [American Mathematical Monthly](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/american-mathematical-monthly), [SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-journal-on-numerical-analysis-sinum), [Operations Research Letters](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/operations-research-letters), and [Physical Review E](https://journals.aps.org/pre/), among others. I am also a medical doctor (anesthesiologist), a co-editor at [Journal of Mathematical Economics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-mathematical-economics), and an associate editor at [Economic Theory](https://www.springer.com/journal/199). Please see my [research page](/publications/) for more details.

## My values
I find it beautiful when regularity and complexity come together. Some corollaries of this statement are:

- I like mathematics,
- I like power law behavior,
- I like bubbles,
- My favorite composer is [J. S. Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach),
- My favorite artist is [M. C. Escher](https://mcescher.com/),
- I like short, simple papers that are to the point.

I also like programming, chess, and tennis, although I am not particularly good at those.

## My Erdős number
My current [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3, based on the following connections (you can use [this tool](https://zbmath.org/collaboration-distance/) to compute your Erdős number or the collaboration distance between anybody, though the tool is not perfect):

| 0 | 1 | 2| 3 |
