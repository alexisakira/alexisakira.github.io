It was [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/sports/tennis/wimbledon-ban-russia-belarus-players.html) that Wimbledon will ban Russian (and Belarusian) players because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

This does not make any sense, and it is simply discrimination based on nationality. Tennis players play individually, and their nationality is irrelevant (except perhaps in the Davis Cup or the ATP Cup). Just as much as I would like to see Nadal's brilliant play, I would like to see Medvedev and Rublev performing at their best. I don't care if they are from Spain, Russia, or North Korea.

The same applies to science. When I read research papers, I only care about their content; the authors' identities or nationalities are irrelevant. In fact, soon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a journal editor (for which I serve as an associate editor) sent us a message reminding us that authors' nationalities are irrelevant for peer review.

Shame on you, Wimbledon.
