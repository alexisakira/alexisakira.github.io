I often fly bewteen San Diego and Atlanta, usually with Delta (because there are more flight options than Alaska, which also offers direct flights between SAN and ATL). As I was looking to book my next trips, I noticed that flight tickets got much more expensive, often over $600 round trip with Delta (main cabin). After playing around with various searches, I realized that if I book a round trip from Atlanta instead of from San Diego, the price drops by 25% or more. I am not sure why, but maybe it's because if I book from Atlanta, the trip is over the weekend, so the booking system may judge myself as a (price-sensitive) leisure traveller. By using Alaska instead of Delta, the price often drops below $300 round trip. Although I have achieved gold status with Delta, since Alaska is much cheaper and also offers status match, I will likely switch.
