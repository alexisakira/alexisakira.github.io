In my [article yesterday](https://alexisakira.github.io/posts/2025/02/blog-post-02/), I discussed the book [_Baby Steps Millionaires_](https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Steps-Millionaires-Extraordinary-Wealth/dp/1942121598) by Dave Ramsey. This book presents many real world examples of ordinary people achieving financial independence ("millionaire") through hard work, discipline, and consistent investment. These stories are all inspiring.

Yes, I am also a millionaire. My story may not be as insipiring, but let me add to the sample.

I grew up in an upper middle class family in Japan. My dad was an engineer-turned-consultant and was making good money, perhaps around 150k per year. My mom was a French teacher and was making perhaps 50k. However, none of them knew about achieving financial independence. My dad was essentially a gambler, and tried all sorts of "get rich quick" tricks and failed. I heard that before I was born, he inherited a house from his grandmother, sold it, used the proceed to invest in oil futures, and lost everything. He also bought three real estates in 1990 at the height of the Japanese real estate bubble, and all properties declined in value by 80%. I recall answering phone calls (there were land lines in those days) from debt collectors. My dad was also cheap but not frugal, often buying unnecessary stuffs at a discount. My mom's siblings often told me, hey Akira, if you do everything opposite to your father, you will be a millionaire.

I grew up in the post-1990 "lost decades" in Japan, so for me financial security was extremely important. One of my goals was to be financially independent as soon as possible. So, although my real interest was mathematics, I worked hard and went to the medical school at University of Tokyo. In Japan, medical schools are 6-year undergraduate programs. The first two years, I just studied math. The remaining four years at the medical shcool was painful. During this period, I got interested in economics, and decided to switch my field after getting all the certifications in medicine.

I finished college in 2004 with essentially no asset. My first job was a resident at a hospital in rural Hokkaido, the northernmost island in Japan. Most of my classmates remained in Tokyo in prestegious residency programs, but I had no intention of staying in medicine and clibming up the ladder so I chose my program purely for short-term pragmatic reasons. My hospital offered me a 60k salary, about twice as much in Tokyo (because there was a shortage of doctors in Hokkaido), and the cost of living was less than half of Tokyo. Besides, Hokkaido is similar to Canada, with beautiful forests and lakes, mild summers, and harsh winters. All my colleagues at the hospital bought cars with their salary, but I did some math and decided it is more efficient to just rent a car when necessary. By the time I finished my residency in 2006, I had about 70k of savings, mostly in cash.

I did a master in economics at University of Tokyo in 2006-2008. During this time, I went to school three days a week for coursework, and worked 4 days a week as a part-time doctor, making about 180k a year. During my studies, somehow I read [_A Random Walk Down Wall Street_](https://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/1324035439) by Burton Malkiel, which was a life-changing revelation. Until then, my asset was about half cash, the rest in individual stocks and mutual funds, but I was investing with no purpose. Random Walk taught me how to get rich slowly but surely by just investing in index funds. Because brokerage firms and mutual funds in Japan charged high expenses, I decided to open a brokerage account in U.S. When I obtained my master in 2008, my net worth was about 200k, half of it in cash and the rest in index ETFs like [VTI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VTI/).

Then I moved to U.S. for my Ph.D. at Yale, and the financial crisis hit. I recall perhaps on September 30, 2008, the stock market plunged 10% overnight, I lost about 10k in one day, and I couldn't sleep. As I knew about the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, I was very worried about the U.S. and the global economy. However, during the past 200 years, the stock market has always come back from crashes and continued to grow. So, I decided to set my fear aside and invest all my cash position of 100k into stocks, 10k per month for 10 months. By March 2009, my net worth declined to about 150k, but that was the bottom. Since then, I just buy-and-hold index fund ETFs. By the time I obtained my Ph.D. in 2013, my net worth was 780k. I have to admit this is not all from investment. Yale gave me a stipend of 37k per year, and each year my wife and I spent two months in summer in Japan to work as part-time doctors, so our household income was close to 100k during all my Ph.D. (And we hardly paid any taxes, because our incomes in each of U.S. and Japan were modest and we were non-residents.)

The rest of the story is boring. Just by working, budgeting, saving, and investing, I became a millionaire in February 2015. I have to admit that getting a head start with a medical degree helped. I was also lucky that I was 50% in cash when the financial crisis hit, and I went all-in in stocks at the right time. But it is really hard work, discipline, and consistency that gets you to be a millionaire, and I am convinced pretty much anybody (born in a developed country) who desires can achieve it.
