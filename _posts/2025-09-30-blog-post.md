Great news. Starting from the September 2025 issue, [*Econ Journal Watch*](https://econjwatch.org/) publishes papers typeset in LaTeX.

For years, I have been begging the editorial board of EJW to accept LaTeX submissions. This summer, I attempted to submit a [comment](/files/EJW.pdf) to urge EJW to accept LaTeX submissions, but to my surprise, I was told EJW was working to transition to LaTeX over the summer, so the point of my comment became moot. The [call for papers](https://econjwatch.org/call-for-papers/) does not seem to be updated yet, but we will see whether they will officially announce that they welcome LaTeX submissions.
