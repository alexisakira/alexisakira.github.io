[This](https://edsource.org/updates/california-colleges-slavery-descendants-admissions) is insane. The [California Assembly Bill 7](https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB7/id/3029617) states

>This bill would state that the California State University, the University of California, independent institutions of higher education, and private postsecondary educational institutions may consider providing a preference in admissions to an applicant who is a descendant of slavery, as defined, to the extent it does not conflict with federal law.

As a classical liberal, I believe that whether you should be admitted to college or not depends only on your merit, and who your ancenstors were has no relevance. Besides, how do you even verify whether one of your ancestors was a slave?

The radical left have often promoted discrimination under the name of DEI. This one has the same intention, although it is carefully worded ("may consider providing a preference [...] to the extent it does not conflict with federal law") so that it is not legally binding.
