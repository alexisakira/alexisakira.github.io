The [compensation at University of California](https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu/wage/) has just published the figures for 2023. I have updated the data set for [my paper](https://alexisakira.github.io/publications/2019-EJW/) and run regressions. In case readers are interested in predicting their salaries, the prediction equation in 2023 is
\\[\log y = 12.12 -0.0100T + 0.0052N_\textrm{pub} + 0.0204N_\textrm{top5} + 0.2485D_\textrm{assoc} + 0.5048D_\text{full}, \\]
where \\(y\\) is the 9-month salary, \\(T\\) is the number of years elapsed since obtaining Ph.D., \\(N_\textrm{pub}\\) is the cumulative number of peer-reviewed research articles, \\(N_\textrm{top5}\\) is the cumulative number of top 5 publications, and \\(D_\textrm{assoc}, D_\textrm{full}\\) are dummy variables for associate and full professors.

For comparison, I present both the 2022 and 2023 scatter plots. Congratulations to Jeff Clemens and Paul Niehaus for the big raise.
