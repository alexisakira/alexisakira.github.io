As the year-end approaches, it is time to perform a cost-benefit analysis of my credit cards. Here I discuss the [Costco Anywhere Visa Card](https://www.costco.com/credit-card.html).

The structure is relatively simple. There is no annual fee, but only Costco members can have this card. Therefore, the effective annual fee is $130 for Executive members. The rewards are
- 5% on gas at Costco,
- 4% on other eligible gas and EV charging,
- 3% on restaurants and eligible travel,
- 2% on Costco purchases, and
- 1% on all other purchases.

In the past, I have blindly used this card for gas (regardless of whether it was at Costco), EV charging, restaurants, Costco, and some travel. This year, I earned the following cashback:
- $1.05 on gas at Costco,
- $8.13 on other eligible gas and EV charging,
- $147.92 on restaurants,
- $172.52 on travel,
- $204.23 on Costco purchases, and
- $6.52 on all other purchases.
Noting that the Executive membership costs $130 and that Executive members get an additional 2% cashback on Costco purchases, we can compute that the average cashback rate was 2.82%. Therefore, it is well worth keeping the card, as my opportunity cost is 2% as discussed [here](https://alexisakira.github.io/posts/2025/12/blog-post-06/).

However, my credit card usage was not optimal for several reasons. First, I shouldn't have spent anything on "all other purchases", which earns only 1%. This is because the definition of categories is sometimes unclear. For instance, I thought bakeries count as dining out, and rideshares count as travel, but that is not the case. For rideshares, I should use the [American Express Blue Cash Preferred Card](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/blue-cash-preferred/), as discussed [here](https://alexisakira.github.io/posts/2025/12/blog-post-06/). Furthermore, I found that booking independent hotels sometimes does not trigger the 3% cashback on travel.

Second, 3% cashback on travel is not necessarily a good deal. Booking travel through the travel portals of American Express, Capital One, and Chase (using the corresponding cards) often gives you 5% cashback.

Although I like this card overall, the two features that I dislike are:
1. The credit card statement does not show how much cashback I earned through each transaction.
1. Cashback is applied only once a year.
In this sense, I prefer American Express because it is clear what we are earning, and we can redeem points or cashback anytime we want.
