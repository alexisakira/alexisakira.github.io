In my [post](https://alexisakira.github.io/posts/2025/08/blog-post-06/), I mentioned that I have been happy with the [Capital One Quicksilver Card](https://i.capitalone.com/JoI8RuaOd) because it offered 0% intro APR for 15 months (and the card has no annual fee and gives 1.5% cash back on all purchases).

I referred my wife to open an account, and we both received the referral bonus. But what has been truly great is the targeted deals through Capital One Shopping. We are now remodelling our two bathrooms that are over 20 years old. As my wife has been searching for fixtures, she has started receiving targeted deals from Home Depot, Lowe's, Bed Bath & Beyond, etc., often offering 15% cash back. Furthermore, the timing of our remodelling coincided with Black Friday/Cyber Week sales (of course, intentionally), so we often get an additional 20% off from the merchants. Overall, I think we saved a few thousand dollars by optimizing credit card use.

I highly recommend the card to anybody. If you open an account by clicking this [link](https://i.capitalone.com/JoI8RuaOd), you will receive an extra sign-up bonus.
