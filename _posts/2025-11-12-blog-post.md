While studying how to legally save on taxes, I realized the following trick.

1. Transfer appreciated stocks to your child's [UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) custodial account](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/custodial-account-for-kids).
1. Sell the stock while keeping the capital gains within $1,350.
1. Use the fund in whatever way you like.

This procedure completely avoids capital gains tax (15% at my tax bracket). The reason is that the standard deduction for a child is $1,350, so as long as income is below that amount, there is no need to file or pay taxes.

I wish I had known about this trick earlier, but it's better to learn about it later than never. As I have substantial shares of [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti) that I bought in 2010 for $60 per share but are now valued at around $335, I transferred a few shares to my kids' UTMA accounts and sold them. Turning appreciated stocks into cash is almost alchemy.
