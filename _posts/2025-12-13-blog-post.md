With my [American Express Delta SkyMiles Platinum Card](https://creditcard.delta.com/us/credit-cards/offers/card/delta-skymiles-platinum-american-express-card/), I received a targeted offer for 5 extra Delta SkyMiles per dollar for purchasing a Delta gift card. In addition, Delta is also running a promotion with a $25 Uber voucher for those who buy $300 or more in Delta gift cards.

As I am a frequent user of both Delta and Uber, I have just bought a $300 gift card, which gives me $25 Uber voucher and \\((1+5)\times 300=1800\\) SkyMiles. As one mile is valued at around 1.1 cents and my Platinum card gives a 15% discount on using miles, I estimate that 1800 miles is worth around \\(1800\times 1.1/85=23.3\\) dollars. So, in total, I recovered around $48 of benefits that I am sure to use within the next couple of months by spending $300, which is pretty good. But this sort of credit card optimization is not worth the effort unless I like optimization itself.
