The [University of California compensation data](https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu/wage/) for 2024 is now published. I have updated the data set for [my paper](https://alexisakira.github.io/publications/2019-EJW/) and rerun the regressions. For readers interested in predicting their salaries, the 2023 prediction equation is
\\[\log y = 12.20 -0.0096T + 0.0051N_\textrm{pub} + 0.0252N_\textrm{top5} + 0.2181D_\textrm{tenure} + 0.2601D_\text{full}, \\]
where \\(y\\) is the 9-month salary, \\(T\\) is the number of years elapsed since obtaining Ph.D., \\(N_\textrm{pub}\\) is the cumulative number of peer-reviewed research articles, \\(N_\textrm{top5}\\) is the cumulative number of top 5 publications, and \\(D_\textrm{tenure}, D_\textrm{full}\\) are dummy variables for tenure and full professor.

For comparison, I show the scatter plots from both 2023 and 2024. Congratulations to Jeff Clemens and Paul Niehaus for their substantial raises, as was the case in 2023. Notably, two faculty members in the lower left---Kaspar Wuthrich and I---have left. (Kaspar moved to Michigan, another public university, so readers can compare his salary before and after the move.) If I were the department chair, I would focus on retaining faculty in the lower left.
