Recently, I thought about submitting a paper to [Journal of Monetary Economics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-monetary-economics). Upon reading its [submission guideline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-monetary-economics/publish/guide-for-authors), I learned that they charge a submission fee of USD 350, which I found quite expensive.

Nevertheless, I proceeded with the submission, but when it came to paying the submission fee, I found that Elsevier charges 350 GBP, which is much more expensive. See the image below.

I want to believe this is just a glitch, not a scam. Since it seems this issue will take a while to fix, I submitted my paper to a different journal.
