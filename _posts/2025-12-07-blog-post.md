In [this post](https://alexisakira.github.io/posts/2025/01/blog-post-12/), I mentioned that I tracked every single penny of my spending from 2008 to 2022, but I stopped because there was little room left to improve my behavior, and the opportunity cost of keeping track of everything was too high. During this period, I tracked my income and expenditures by manually entering items in an app and using (now discontinued) Mint.com.

I no longer remember when, but because Mint.com had syncing issues, I switched to Personal Capital. Other than occasional sales calls from them, I have been generally satisfied with their service. However, recently, Personal Capital changed to Empower, and in my opinion, their user interface has become much less user-friendly. Therefore, I have been searching for more useful tools.

After trying several free services, it turns out that there was no need to look further. [Fidelity Full View](https://www.fidelity.com/go/monitoring-your-financial-portfolio) provides account syncing for Fidelity customers. The page displays the household balance sheet with assets on the left and liabilities on the right, which I think is beautiful. There is also a function to look at cash flow and spending. The picture below shows my net cash flow in 2025 (blue solid line) and compares it to 2024 (gray dashed line).

We can make three observations.

1. Net cash flow was declining until around August 2024.
1. Net cash flow was stable between August 2024 and August 2025.
1. Net cash flow has been on an upward trajectory since August 2025.

The explanation for these observations is very simple. First, I was so underpaid at UCSD (see [this post](https://alexisakira.github.io/posts/2024/08/blog-post-23/)) that my financial situation was precarious until I resigned at the end of June 2024. Second, by moving to Emory, I obviously got a raise (to reflect fundamentals), which improved my financial situation since July 2024. Third, because of differences in fiscal years and payment timing between the two universities, in the 2024-2025 academic year, my salary from Emory was divided into 14 monthly payments instead of 12. This is why my cash flow improved since August 2025: my salary is now divided into 12 monthly payments.
