As I am preparing for my first teaching assignments at Emory, I started from creating a syllabus template. My department provided a Word template, which was not exactly to my taste, so wrote a template in \\(\LaTeX\\) [here](/files/syllabus_template.zip). The version titled ``syllabus_template.tex`` follows the basic structure of the Emory economics template, and the version titled ``syllabus_template_toda.tex`` adds some of my information that I use across all my courses. A few comments:

- I used the ``moderncv`` package, which looks nice.
- To make the syllabus colorful, I defined the color ``pantone`` as ``\definecolor{pantone}{RGB}{1, 33, 105}``, which is the official Emory color, and used the ``titlesec`` package to use that color for section titles.
- I defined the ``\note`` command to add important notes.
- As usual, ``biblatex`` is very useful for creating reading lists. There are so many ways to customize.
