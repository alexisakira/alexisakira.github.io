Three years ago, I wrote a [blog post](https://alexisakira.github.io/posts/2021/11/blog-post-14/) in which I mentioned that I stopped (strictly speaking, significantly reduced) contributing in 403(b) and 457(b) retirement savings plans because I could no longer afford it.

Now that I got a new job (with a higher salary), I have the luxury of investing again. There are several factors that have changed over the past few years, which is worth discussing. First, 403(b) now allows a Roth acount. Second, inflation has been high. These factors begs a fresh analysis. For simplicity, let \\(\tau\\) be the tax rate, \\(r\\) be the real rate of return on investment (continuously compounded), \\(i\\) the inflation rate, and \\(t\\) be the investment horizon. Suppose I have a pre-tax income of \\(Y\\) available for investment.

If the money is invested in a retirement account, because capital gains are not taxed, investment grows at a nominal rate \\(r+i\\). Therefore, regardless of whether it is invested in a traditional account (you pay taxes when withdrawing) or in a Roth account (you pay taxes before investment), the resulting amount in real terms is \\((1-\tau)Ye^{(r+i)t}/e^{it}=(1-\tau)Ye^{rt}\\). Thus, inflation has no impact on investment.

In contrast, if the money is invested in a taxable account, assuming that capital gains are realized continuously, investment grows at a nominal rate \\((1-\tau)(r+i)\\). Therefore the resulting amount in real terms is \\((1-\tau)Ye^{(1-\tau)(r+i)t}/e^{it}=(1-\tau)Ye^{(r-(r+i)\tau)t}\\). Thus, taxes and inflation drags the investment performance by rate \\((r+i)\tau\\), which is the product of nominal return and tax rate. This observation has a significant implication. If we assume conservativelly that the nominal return is 10% (real return 7% plus inflation 3%) and the marginal tax rate is 30%, then the investment performance decreases by 3% (\\(0.1\times 0.3=0.03\\)) annually. A difference of 3\% annually is enourmous in the investment world.

Of course, taxable and retirement accounts have their own advantages and disadtanvages, so taxes should not be the only consideration. With a taxable account, you have liquidity. With a retirement account, you give up liquidity. Another consideration is the difference between traditional and Roth accounts. Traditional accounts have a required minimum distribution, wheras Roth accounts do not. Furthermore, both traditional and Roth accounts have the same annual contribution limits (currently \$23,000 for 403(b)), so Roth allows a larger investment in pre-tax dollars. For instance, at 30\% tax rate, to invest \$10,000, traditional requires \$10,000 of pre-tax income, whereas Roth requires \$14,286. With my current employer, 9% of my salary is matched and contributed to a traditional account, and 457(b) is also traditional. Therefore it seems wise to max out the remaining investments in Roth.
