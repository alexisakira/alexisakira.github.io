In my [post](https://alexisakira.github.io/posts/2025/01/blog-post-24/), I mentioned I opened the [CapitalOne Quicksilver Card](https://i.capitalone.com/JoI8RuaOd) because it offered 0% intro APR for 15 months (and the card has no annual fee and gives 1.5% cash back on all purchases).

I have been using the card for about half a year, and so far I am very happy. In particular, I paid my federal and state income taxes using the card, so I essentially deferred the tax payment by one year, interest-free. (The IRS charges 1.75% fee for paying taxes with a credit card, but because the card gives 1.5% cash back, it is nearly offset.) I highly recommend the card to anybody. If you open an account by clicking this [link](https://i.capitalone.com/JoI8RuaOd), you will receive an extra sign up bonus.
