I have been waiting almost 9 months for the replacement battery for my 2016 Nissan Leaf, and the delay is extremely frustrating.

Given that I haven't heard anything from the dealer, I contacted the Nissan USA customer service. The arbitration department responded, informing me that a buyback is being offered. However, they have not yet provided the terms or numbers, so I am still awaiting those details.

It seems that many people have a similar experience. According to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaf/comments/12rvz56/update_got_the_warranty_battery_replacement_after/), a person waited for 6 months and got an upgrade to a 40kWh battery. I believe the original 30kWh batteries are no longer manufactured, so if I do get a battery, it will likely be a 40kWh one.
