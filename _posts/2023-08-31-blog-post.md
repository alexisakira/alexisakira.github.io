I am still waiting for the replacement battery for my 2016 Nissan Leaf. It's nearly 9 months wait now.

Given that I haven't heard anything from the dealer, I contacted the Nissan USA customer service. The arbitration department reached out and offered me a buyback. They haven't showed me the numbers yet, and I am looking forward to seeing it.

It seems that many people have a similar experience. According to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaf/comments/12rvz56/update_got_the_warranty_battery_replacement_after/), a person waited for 6 months and got an upgrade to 40kWh battery. I believe the original 30kWh batteries are no longer manufactured, so if I do get a battery it will likely be 40kWh.
