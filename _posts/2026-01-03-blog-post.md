Here are my 2026 financial resolutions.

## Contribute to IRA using backdoor Roth

In 2026, the IRA contribution limit increased to $7,500 (from $7,000). I will max out both for my wife and me.

## Contribute to HSA

In 2026, the HSA contribution limit (family) has increased to $8,750 (from $8,550). Since I have two HSAs (one for my workplace and one with Fidelity), I will wait to contribute the last few hundred dollars to Fidelity to avoid over-contributing (since my workplace HSA sometimes offers additional benefits).

## Donate stocks with capital gains to my kids' UTMA accounts

Donating stocks lets me realize up to $1,350 in capital gains tax-free by using this loophole:
- The annual gift tax exclusion limit is $19,000 ($38,000 for married couples filing jointly) (see [here](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/interest-dividends-other-types-of-income/gifts-inheritances/gifts-inheritances-1)).
- Child's unearned income above $2,700 is taxed at parent's rate (see [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-dft/i8615--dft.pdf)).
- Standard deduction for a dependent is $1,350 (see [here](https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/content/00/00_13_005.jsp)).

Therefore, if the market value of the stocks I donate is less than $38,000 and capital gains are less than $1,350, the child does not need to pay any tax.

## Use 529 funds wisely

Since July 2025, the K-12 qualified expenses for 529 plans have significantly expanded (see [here](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/what-you-can-pay-for-with-a-529-plan)). I will keep track of my expenses in a spreadsheet.

## Pay off credit card debt

In 2025, my wife and I have racked up around $50,000 in credit card debt. This may sound insane, but actually, it was on purpose. We each opened the [Capital One Quicksilver card](https://i.capitalone.com/JoI8RuaOd), which offers 0% APR for 15 months and 1.5% cashback on all purchases. We used this card to pay taxes and purchase stuff for our bathroom remodeling project. I have been saving cash using Treasury bills (to avoid state income taxes), so we saved over a thousand dollars from the interest rate arbitrage. (However, my credit score declined from 840 to 790 by racking up credit card debt, though I don't regret it.)

## Downgrade American Express Blue Cash Preferred card

In [this post](https://alexisakira.github.io/posts/2025/12/blog-post-28/), I mentioned that the [AAA Daily Advantage Visa Signature card](https://www.ace.aaa.com/mktg/financial/daily-advantage.html) dominates the [American Express Blue Cash Preferred card](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/blue-cash-preferred/) for groceries. I will downgrade the Amex card to one without an annual fee before the renewal date so that I can keep the long credit history (since 2010).
