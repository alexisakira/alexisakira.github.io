After spending several days, I significantly updated my website. Below is a list of the main changes.

- Previously, there was a "Research" page that I created manually. But it was tedious to list all papers in a consistent style (e.g., journal names in bold, coauthors in italics, etc.), so I automated it.
- I omitted publication information except the journal name and year, because I don't think they are very important, and one can easily find them by clicking the link to the published paper.
- I searched for all my paper drafts on my computer and added slides whenever I found them.
- I merged "Conference proceedings" with "Other publications" because I don't see a reason to keep proceedings as a separate section, given that I don't have many.
