My paper "[Perov's Contraction Principle and Dynamic Programming with Stochastic Discounting](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orl.2021.09.001)" was accepted for publication in [Operations Research Letters](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/operations-research-letters). I found a generalization of [Banach's contraction mapping theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_fixed-point_theorem) while studying a certain dynamic programming problem with stochastic discounting. It turned out the fixed point theorem was due to Perov (1964), but I found the application interesting, so I wrote a short paper.
