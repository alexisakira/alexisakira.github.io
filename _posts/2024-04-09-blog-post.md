Maybe it is not the best use of my time but I created a "[Talks](https://alexisakira.github.io/talks/)" page, which lists past and future talks and presentations. After spending all afternoon tweaking the code, I created something satisfactory. For now I included only talks in 2023 and 2024 but I might add past ones.

- Updated 4/10: Now the talks go back to 2020. It's time consuming to dig old emails and Google Calendar to find the exact dates and titles of the talks.
