I opened 529 accounts for my kids about 15 years ago. Their nominal balances have grown by about 200% over this period. (Actually, this is something that I regret. I enrolled in targeted date funds without thinking too much. Investment returns have suffered since 2020 because the portfolio's bond share increased and inflation was high. I should have invested 100% in stocks instead.)

This year, [529 qualified expenses for K-12 have expanded](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/what-you-can-pay-for-with-a-529-plan) to include course-required books, AP/SAT/ACT exam fees, among others. This is a huge welcome. To qualify for a tax-free withdrawal, expenses and withdrawals must occur in the same calendar year, so I have just created spreadsheets to track expenses and transferred funds from my kids' 529 accounts to my cash management account. Since I didn't remember when I paid the exam fees, [Fidelity Full View](https://www.fidelity.com/go/monitoring-your-financial-portfolio) came in very handy as I was able to search for these expenses.
