This page explains how to string a tennis racquet. When my kids started playing tennis competitively in 2020, it became expensive and inconvenient to frequently visit a racquet shop for stringing. For Christmas, we bought a string machine and I learned to string watching some Youtube videos and articles. Most of them don't cover all the fine details, so here I try to be as comprehensive as possible.

## Before getting started

Before getting started, you need a string machine and tools. The tools you need are shown in the picture below.
