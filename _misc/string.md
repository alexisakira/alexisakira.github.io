This page explains how to string a tennis racquet. When my kids started playing tennis competitively in 2020, it became expensive and inconvenient to frequently visit a racquet shop for stringing. For Christmas, we bought a string machine and I learned to string watching some Youtube videos and articles. Most of them don't cover all the fine details, so here I try to be as comprehensive as possible.

## Before getting started

Before getting started, you need a string machine and tools. The tools you need are shown in the picture below. From left to right, the items are:

1. [stringing clamp](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N1SM3Q/) (useful for starting the mains and making knots)
1. [small wire cutter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SL2TCH7/) (necessary for cutting strings)
1. needle nose plier (useful for removing old strings)
1. [straight awl](https://www.amazon.com/Lixada-Racquet-Stringing-Straight-Badminton/dp/B07J5T9M57/) (useful for working in narrow area)

## Place the racquet

Place the racquet with the bevel in the "up" side as in the picture below, where you can read "JAPAN". This step is not essential but is important for consistent results.

## Prepare the main strings

Identify the string pattern of the racquet from the information on the frame. Most racquets (like the picture below) have string patterns 16/19, meaning there are 16 mains and 19 crosses.

To determine the length of the string for the mains, count "main plus 1". For instance, if the string pattern is 16/19, count 17 from inside the frame to outside the frame.
