After publishing the maximum entropy discretization method in [Tanaka & Toda (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2012.12.020), my coauthor [Ken'ichiro Tanaka](https://kentanakadpp.github.io/), who is an expert on numerical analysis, was interested in the error estimate and convergence analysis of the method. We worked on this in the summer of 2013.
