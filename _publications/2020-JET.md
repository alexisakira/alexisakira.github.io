When I visited the [Australian National University Research School of Economics](https://rse.anu.edu.au/) during the summer of 2018 (it was winter in Australia), I got to know my coauthor [Qingyin Ma](https://qingyin-ma.github.io/), who was a Ph.D. student at ANU. At that time Qingyin and [John](https://johnstachurski.net/) were working on extending [Li & Stachurski (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2014.06.003) on the Euler equation method for solving optimal savings problems to the case with stochastic returns and discount factors. Initially I just helped them on proofreading and giving some feedback, but later I was asked to join the project to prove results on the wealth distribution, applying the Pareto exponent formula in [Beare & Toda (2022)](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA17984).
