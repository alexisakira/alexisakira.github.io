This paper used to be a section of [Toda & Walsh (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1086/682729). The idea is to use the model of [Toda (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2014.09.015) to construct a consumption-based asset pricing model that generates power law tails in the cross-sectional consumption distribution, and then use simulated data (for which we know the data generating process) to study the spurious estimation documented in [Toda & Walsh (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1086/682729). The JPE editor asked us to cut this section to make the paper shorter, so we recycled it.
