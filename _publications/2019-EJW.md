I got tenure at UCSD in 2019, but as the date of tenure review approached, I got interested in how much raise I should expect. So in 2017, I started checking the [compensation at University of California](https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu/wage/) to get an idea. I found the dataset very interesting, as it is error-free. In those days I sometimes talked to [Yifei](https://sites.google.com/view/yifeilyu/home), who was a Ph.D. student interested in applied stuff, so we started gathering data on salary, publications, etc., of our colleagues. We then ran predictive regressions. I was careful not to post a working paper because I did not want to undermine my tenure review, but several esteemed econometricians such as [Brendan](https://www.brendanbeare.com/) and [Yixiao](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~yisun/) found the results interesting and advised us on model specification. After I got tenure, we submitted this paper to [Econ Journal Watch](https://econjwatch.org/), which is one of my favorite journals.

In 2020, when preparing my two-year review file, I updated the dataset to present evidence to the department chair and administration that I was significantly underpaid.
