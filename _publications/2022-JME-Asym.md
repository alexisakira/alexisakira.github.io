This is a follow up paper of [Ma & Toda (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2021.105193). We proved the asymptotic linearity of consumption functions in optimal savings problem when marginal utility is regulary varying, and to make the paper more appealing to the applied audience, we added an application to computational efficiency.
