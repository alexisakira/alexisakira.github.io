I met my coauthor [Tomohiro Hirano](https://sites.google.com/site/tomohih/) in 2013 when I gave a job talk at University of Tokyo. We stayed in touch, for instance I invited him to the macro seminar at UCSD in 2015 where he presented his [REStud paper on rational bubbles](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdw059), and he also invited me several times to conferences and seminars. In March 2020, right before COVID, I gave a talk at Royal Holloway and met Tomohiro and his colleague [Philip Neary](https://sites.google.com/site/prneary/). Philip told me he had an [Erdős number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) of 3 through the coauthorship with the computer scientist [Gregory Gutin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Gutin). At that time, my Erdős number was 5, so I was interested in getting the number down.

We then joked that perhaps we can write a paper together so that both Tomohiro and I could get the Erdős number 4 through the coauthorship with Philip. When COVID hit, Philip had an idea about an [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) on a network, so we decided to write a paper together. We got greedy and then invited Gregory as a coauthor to get the Erdős number 3.
