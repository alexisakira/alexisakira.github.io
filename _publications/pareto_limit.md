I owe a great deal to coauthor Vincent Geloso for this paper. Vincent has written a series of papers that improve the top income share estimates. In 2023 he found [my paper on nonparametric density estimation from tabulated summary data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2023.105568) and suggested that we apply the method to estimate top income shares from tax returns data. At that time, the literature used Piketty's Pareto interpolation method, which was ad hoc.
