This paper used to be a section of [Toda & Walsh (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1086/682729), where we documented that the cross-sectional distribution of household consumption is double Pareto-lognormally distributed. The JPE editor asked us to cut this section to make the paper shorter. Obviously, I intended to write another joint paper with [Kieran](https://sites.google.com/site/kieranjameswalsh/), but because I did the entire analysis for this section, Kieran recused himself from the project and I recycled the section as a standalone paper.

The review process at MD took such a long time that I never submitted a paper to MD again. I hope the improved the speed.
