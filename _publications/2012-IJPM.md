The first author, [Mitsuhiro Nakamura](https://www.shinano-mc.com/?page_id=122), is a psychiatrist with whom I overlapped at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo. (I graduated there in 2004 and Mitsuhiro was one year junior.) In 2010, Mitsuhiro was a master student at the School of Public Health, University of Tokyo, and he approached me for analyzing data related to the [2008 outbreak of hydrogen sulfide suicides](https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-6673-5-28) in Japan. I wrote some Matlab files to implement the GMM estimation and became a coauthor.
