I learned econometrics from [Fumio Hayashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumio_Hayashi) in 2006 using his textbook [*Econometrics*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691010182/econometrics). In an exercise related to deriving the variance matrix of efficient GMM on p.245, Hayashi states without proof

> Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be two positive definite and symmetric matrices. \\(A-B\\) is positive semidefinite if and only if \\(B^{-1}-A^{-1}\\) is positive semidefinite.

I am a mathematically oriented person who is skeptical about mathematical statements until seeing their proofs. Although I found the proof in [Horn & Johnson (1985) *Matrix Analysis*](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511810817), Corollary 7.7.4(a), their proof was not very intuitive. In 2010, I came up with a very simple proof based on [convex conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_conjugate) functions that work for any self-adjoint linear operators on Hilbert spaces.
