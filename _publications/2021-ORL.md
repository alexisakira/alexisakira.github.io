excerpt: "(Mathematics) Show the usefulness of Perov's contraction principle (which is a generalization of Banach's contraction principle) for solving certain dynamic programming problems."

When I was working on a series of papers on optimal savings and dynamic programming ([Ma et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2020.105003); Ma & Toda, [2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2021.105193), [2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmateco.2021.102562)), I was not entirely happy with the proof technique because it relied on eventual contractions instead of contractions, and the argument was slightly complicated. One day in November 2020, I came up with an idea of generalizing the Banach contraction theorem to a matrix version using the spectral radius of a certain nonnegative matrix. I sent the paper to ORL, and after getting an R&R, I learned that the theorem I proved already existed as the Perov contraction theorem, so I rewrote the paper entirely to change the focus.
