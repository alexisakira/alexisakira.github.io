When I wrote the series of my discretization papers (Tanaka & Toda ([2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2012.12.020), [2015](https://doi.org/10.1137/140971269)), [Farmer & Toda (2017)](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE737)), I didn't know much about [numerical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration). In 2017, I taught numerical methods to Ph.D. students and studied quadrature methods myself. I realized that the Golub-Welssh algorithm of [Gaussian quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature) requires only inputting the moments of the probability distribution, so I thought I can feed in sample moments to discretize a nonparametric distribution from data. It was not a big deal, so after some procrastination I wrote up the paper in a few days in May 2018.
