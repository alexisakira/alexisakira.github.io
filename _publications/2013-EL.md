When I was working on my [job market paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2336582) in 2012, I had to solve a numerical example and needed to compute some expectations that do not have closed-form expressions. Believe it or not, in those days I didn't know about [numerical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration), and instead of googling, I came up with a method to assign probabilities on grid points to match moments by applying the [maximum entropy principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy), which I was familiar. I approached my former classmate [Ken'ichiro Tanaka](https://kentanakadpp.github.io/), who is an expert on numerical analysis, and we wrote a paper together.
