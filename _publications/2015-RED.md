This paper used to be a section of [Toda (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2014.09.015). During the review process, the editor asked me to omit a section because it was tangential. After the paper was accepted, I recycled the section as a standalone paper. During the review process, I learned a good deal of differential topology by reading [Villanacci et al. (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4757-3619-9).
