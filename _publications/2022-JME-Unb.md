This paper was originally a project of [John](https://johnstachurski.net/) and [Qingyin](https://qingyin-ma.github.io/), but they invited me to work on extensions and applications in 2020. I thought it was a neat idea to transform an unbounded dynamic programming problem to a bounded one, so I joined.
