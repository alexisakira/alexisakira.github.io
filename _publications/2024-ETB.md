excerpt: "(Theory) Combine weighted supremum norm and Perov contraction theorem for solving unbounded dynamic programming problems."

I learned the weighted supremum norm approach for solving unbounded dynamic programming problems when working on [Ma et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmateco.2022.102652). In the summer of 2023, when I was preparing for math camp and working on my textbook, I found that we can solve a larger class of unbounded dynamic programming problems by combining the weighted supremum norm approach and the Perov contraction theorem, so I wrote a paper.
