excerpt: "(Mathematics) High-dimensional generalization of the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the radii of escribed circles of a triangle equals the reciprocal of the radius of the inscribed circle; obtained those results in 1998 when I was freshman."

In the picture below, \\(A_1A_2A_3\\) is a triangle, \\(I_0\\) is the center of the inscribed circle with radius \\(r_0\\), and \\(I_1,I_2,I_3\\) are the centers of the escribed circles with radii \\(r_1,r_2,r_3\\). It is known that
\\[ \frac{1}{r_1}+\frac{1}{r_2}+\frac{1}{r_3}=\frac{1}{r_0}. \\]
I don't know the original source, but it appears as Exercise 6 in Section 1.4 of [Coxeter & Greitzer (1967)](https://bookstore.ams.org/nml-19/).

When I attended middle and high schools in the 1990s, I was fascinated by elementary geometry. I recall I discovered the above relation in 1997. In 1998, when I was a freshman at University of Tokyo, I found the three-dimensional generalization
\\[ \frac{1}{r_1}+\frac{1}{r_2}+\frac{1}{r_3}+\frac{1}{r_4}=\frac{2}{r_0}, \\]
where \\(r_0\\) is the radius of the inscribed sphere of a tetrahedron and \\(r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4\\) are the radii of the four escribed spheres. Based on some geometric intuition I conjectured that in the \\(n\\)-dimensional Euclidean space, the relation
\\[ \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{r_k}=\frac{n-1}{r_0} \\]
would hold. After studying linear algebra in 1999, I proved this analytically.

In those days I didn't know how to publish papers, so my notes became dormant. After learning how to write papers and obtaining an academic job in 2013, I managed to publish it.
