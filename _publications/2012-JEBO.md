At Yale, third year PhD students were required to write an empirical paper. When I was third year in 2010, my initial intention was to see whether income is exponentially distributed, which is an implication of my earlier paper [Toda (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00199-009-0493-6). Upon inspecting CPS data, I found that the income distribution has both upper and lower [Pareto tails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution). I thought about the rationalization and noticed that the stochastic differential equation used in [Alfarano et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2011.07.002) (which was then a 2008 working paper) can rationalize it, so I applied this mechanism. My interest in power laws started around this time.

Appendix D contains a derivation of the closed-form solution to the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the stochastic differential equation. In 2009, I took a continuous-time finance class from [Jonathan Ingersoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_E._Ingersoll). When he explained the [Black-Scholes model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model), he mentioned something like "if you ever solve a partial differential equation in closed-form, it has already been solved by somebody else". Therefore when I solved the PDE in closed-form, I was quite proud of myself. However, Jonathan turned out to be correct: the solution I obtained was already known in physics [(Chvosta & Reineker, 2003)](https://doi.org/10.1088/0305-4470/36/33/303)!

An abridged version of this paper was published as [Toda (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.83.046122).
