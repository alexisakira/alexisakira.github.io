The [Journal of Mathematical Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Mathematical_Economics), which was founded in 1974, was running a 50th anniversary issue and Kieran (associate editor at JME) was invited to contribute a review article. As we have worked on equilibrium uniqueness, he invited me to write an article together.
