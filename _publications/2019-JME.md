excerpt: "(Power law, Theory, Macro) Formal proof that the [Krusell & Smith (1998)](https://doi.org/10.1086/250034) random discount factor trick generates power law tails; Pareto exponent is sensitive to the calibration of discount factor process."

In 2017, I noticed the [NBER working paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23011) by [Hubmer](https://sites.google.com/site/joachimhubmer), [Krusell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_Krusell), and [Smith](https://economics.yale.edu/people/tony-smith). I was disappointed because although they talk about Pareto distributions (which became fashionable after the 2014 Piketty boom), they didn't cite any of my papers even though my [2014 JET](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2014.09.015) and [2015 JPE](https://doi.org/10.1086/682729) papers were relevant for their model. It's true that I don't belong to the quantitative macro club so people may not read my papers, but Tony was my advisor at Yale.

So, although it seemed obvious to me, to teach quantitative macroeconomists that heterogeneous discount factors can generate Pareto-tailed wealth distributions (because the saving rate and hence the growth rate of wealth becomes heterogeneous) and how the exponents can be calculated without running any simulations, I decided to write a paper targeted for an applied audience. By this time, [Brendan](https://www.brendanbeare.com/) and I had a draft of our [Econometrica paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA17984), so I knew how to reverse-engineer a Huggett model with Markov-dependent discount factors to generate Pareto tails with an exact characterization. 
I wrote the paper in a few weeks but there was one tricky part. To characterize the optimal consumption rule using dynamic programming, I needed to show the existence of a fixed point of a certain nonlinear operator that is not necessarily a contraction. [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/) kindly taught me the trick. I submitted the paper to JME. The handling associate editor, [Alisdair McKay](https://alisdairmckay.com/), helped me a lot in making the paper attractive to an applied audience. I owe him for writing Section 4.
