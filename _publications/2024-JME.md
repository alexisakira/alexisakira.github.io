excerpt: "üëç(Theory, Macro, Finance) Self-contained review of the theory of asset price bubbles."

My coauthor [Tomohiro](https://sites.google.com/site/tomohih/) introduced me to the theory of asset price bubbles and we started to work together in the summer of 2022. By the fall of 2023, we wrote many papers that we think are ground-breaking. JME was running a 50th anniversary issue and (being a coeditor) I was invited to contribute a review article on the topic of my choice, so I invited Tomohiro to write a self-contained review that covers the foundation, classical results, as well as the frontier. I think this paper is the best introduction to anybody interested in asset price bubbles.
