This paper evolved from my master thesis at University of Tokyo. After completing my coursework in 2006-2007, I didn't know what to write for my master thesis. My advisor [Hiroshi Yoshikawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Yoshikawa) suggested that I study [Foley's (1994)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jeth.1994.1018) statistical equilibrium model. I found the paper interesting but I thought the model does not easily extend to a production economy, so that's what I did in my thesis. Along the way, I learned a good deal about convex optimization and duality.
