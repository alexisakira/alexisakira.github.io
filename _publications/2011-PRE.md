At Yale, third year PhD students were required to write an empirical paper. When I was third year in 2010, my initial intention was to see whether income is exponentially distributed, which is an implication of my earlier paper [Toda (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00199-009-0493-6). Upon inspecting CPS data, I found that the income distribution has both upper and lower [Pareto tails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution). I thought about the rationalization and noticed that the stochastic differential equation used in [Alfarano et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2011.07.002) (which was then a 2008 working paper) can rationalize it, so I applied this mechanism. My interest in power laws started around this time.

This is an abridged version intended for physicists, and the full version was published as [Toda (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2012.04.012).
