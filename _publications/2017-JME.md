In 2015, I was working on a now dormant project with my student [Yoshiyuki Miyoshi](https://www.rieti.go.jp/users/miyoshi-yoshiyuki/index_en.html). When conducting numerical experiments, Yoshiyuki found that the economic growth rate increases with government intervention. It turns out that it is because government transfers crowd out the annuity market.
