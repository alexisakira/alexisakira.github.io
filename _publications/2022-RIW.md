excerpt: "(Power law, Empirical) Estimate capital and labor income Pareto exponents across 475 country-year observations and document that capital income inequality is higher than labor income inequality (median Pareto exponents 1.46 and 3.35 respectively) and the two inequalities are uncorrelated, suggesting importance of distinguishing the two."
