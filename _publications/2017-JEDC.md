excerpt: "(Theory, Macro) Closed-form solution to a [Huggett (1993)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-1889(93)90024-M) economy with non-Gaussian VAR(1) dynamics and general examples of multiple stationary equilibria."

I learned reading [Calvet (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1016/10.1006/jeth.2000.2720) how to obtain closed-form solutions in optimal savings problems. In 2017, I played around with this type of models to obtain closed-form solutions to Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari models. I showed my notes to [Jinhui Bai](https://cahnrs.wsu.edu/people-directory/people/wsu-profile/jinhui.bai/) who happens to be a Yale graduate with the same set of advisors as me ([Truman Bewley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Bewley), [John Geanakoplos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Geanakoplos), and [Tony Smith](https://economics.yale.edu/people/tony-smith)) and knows the literature well, and he pointed me to [Wang (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1257/000282803322157179). I played around further, and given my recent interest in [uniqueness and multiplicity of equilibria](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40505-016-0102-3), I constructed examples of Huggett economies with multiple stationary equilibria. I initially submitted the paper to JET and got rejected, but the reports were rather good so I sent the paper to JEDC with JET reports attached, and I had a smooth review process there.
