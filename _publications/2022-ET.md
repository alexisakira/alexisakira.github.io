This is a follow up paper of [Beare & Toda (2022)](https://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA17984), where we characterize the tail behavior of Markov-modulated Lévy processes that are stopped at state-dependent Poisson rates. [Brendan](https://www.brendanbeare.com/) gave the project to [Won-Ki](https://sites.google.com/site/wkseo86/), who was his student. I joined Won-Ki's dissertation committee to advise on this project, and we essentially translated the discrete-time results in [Beare & Toda (2022)](https://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA17984) to continuous-time. The CARA-Huggett economy example in Section 4 was recycled from an earlier version of Beare & Toda (2022).
