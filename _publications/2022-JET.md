excerpt: "üëç(Theory) Study a behavioral SIR model with imperfect testing and government enforcement and show that equilibrium action is approximately static efficient in the sense that the laissez faire equilibrium allocation is close to the optimal short-term lockdown policy, implying that short-term lockdown policies are redundant."

After writing my [SIR paper](https://cepr.org/publications/covid-economics-issue-1) in March 2020, I got interested in adding more realistic features such as agents' optimizing behavior and the possibility of imperfect testing such as asymptomatic infections. At that time I was in touch with [Tom Phelan](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/thomasphelan/), who was at the Cleveland Fed and asked me some question about my [discretization paper](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE737). So we started this project. Because the agents' problem was complicated (agents need to correctly infer the aggregate dynamics as well as form beliefs about their health status), we invited [Joel Sobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Sobel) to work together. All of us worked hard, but none of us could prove the existence of a Markov perfect Bayesian equilibrium with a continuum of agents. Joel and I had difference in opinions. Joel (a game theorist) insisted that we should use a continuum of agents, for otherwise it is inconsistent with perfect competition. On the other hand, I (a general equilibrium theorist) was fine with a large but finitely many agents, and my priority was to publish this paper before the pandemic is over. We could not resolve our disagreement, so Joel left the project and Tom and I wrote the paper.

The main theoretical result of this paper is quite interesting. Because the exeternality of infections is caused by the interaction of susceptible and infected agents, which is second order, to the first order agents internalize the effect of infected agents, so lockdown policies are redundant. This supports my earlier claim in the [April 2020 VoxEU](https://voxeu.org/article/early-draconian-social-distancing-may-be-suboptimal-fighting-covid-19-epidemic#) and [May 2020 Fortune](https://fortune.com/2020/05/04/reopening-reopen-economy-coronavirus-covid-19-lifting-lockdown-economists) opinion pieces that lockdown policies are bad, which I think everybody agrees ex post. After getting rejected from Econometrica, in the interest of getting it published before it's too late, we sent it to JET.
