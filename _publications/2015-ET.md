This is a follow up paper of [Toda (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00199-009-0493-6). The idea is to interpret a Walras equilibrium as a special limiting case of a statistical equilibrium. I started working on this project in 2009 to prepare for my second-year qualifying exam (which is oral) at Yale. [Truman Bewley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Bewley), [Don Brown](https://economics.yale.edu/people/donald-j-brown), and [John Geanakoplos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Geanakoplos) advised me on this project, and later Don Brown advised me *against* it because I wouldn't get an academic job with this topic. Following his advice, I let the project go, but after getting an academic job in 2013, I went back to it and published.
