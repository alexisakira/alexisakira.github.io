excerpt: "üëç(Theory, Macro) Prove asymptotic linearity of policy functions when preferences are homothetic; show that asymptotic marginal propensities to consume can be zero, implying a large saving rate of the rich."

When I was working on my [Pareto extrapolation paper](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE1817) with [√âmilien](https://sites.google.com/view/emilien/home), an important ingredient was the asymptotic slopes of policy functions such as consumption functions. Although the asymptotic linearity of consumption functions with homothetic preferences was a folk theorem, nobody proved it rigorously or characterized the asymptotic slopes. So in November 2019, I wrote some preliminary notes, and asked [John](https://johnstachurski.net/) and [Qingyin](https://qingyin-ma.github.io/) to work together as a follow up of [Ma et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2020.105003). John was busy and declined, so Qingyin and I worked on it.

Initially we had more theoretical results that assumed only the regular variation of the marginal utility, but I knew from past experience that this sort of technical papers are hard to publish, so we specialized to CRRA and added a detailed numerical application to make the paper more appealing to the general audience. The paper got rejected from ECMA but it was easy at JET.
