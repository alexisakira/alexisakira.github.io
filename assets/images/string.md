This page explains how to string a tennis racquet. When my kids started playing tennis competitively in 2020, it became expensive and inconvenient to frequently visit a racquet shop for stringing. For Christmas, we bought a string machine and I learned to string watching some Youtube videos and articles. Most of them don't cover all the fine details, so here I try to be as comprehensive as possible.

## Before getting started

Before getting started, you need a string machine and tools. The tools you need are shown in the picture below. From left to right, the items are:

1. [stringing clamp](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N1SM3Q/) (useful for starting the mains and making knots)
1. [small wire cutter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SL2TCH7/)
1. needle nose plier (useful for removing old strings)
1. [straight awl](https://www.amazon.com/Lixada-Racquet-Stringing-Straight-Badminton/dp/B07J5T9M57/) (useful for working in narrow area)
