Journal of Economic Theory

Dear Alexis,

I am very pleased to inform you that your paper "An Impossibility Theorem for Wealth in Heterogeneous-agent Models with Limited Heterogeneity" has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Economic Theory.

I sent the paper out to two referees. One failed to respond to the invitation. The other was enthusiastic about the paper and recommends accepting it without revision. I could solicit more reports. But I respect the referee's opinion and I also find the paper clear, concise and important. I intend to accept it and don't see a need to drag it out. Congratulations, this is my first ever first-round acceptance. Nice work.

Thank you for submitting your work to the Journal of Economic Theory and congratulations on this publication.

Yours sincerely,

Laura Veldkamp
