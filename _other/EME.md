I taught math camp at the UCSD economics PhD program from 2015 to 2023. A publisher noticed that I have been posting my lecture notes at my website and solicited its publication as a book. I completely rewrote my notes from 2023 to 2024. I think this is the best textbook on "Mathematics for Economics" out there.
