In May 2023, I read something about [Ergodicity Economics](https://ergodicityeconomics.com/), and I thought it was a completely nonsense pseudoscience promoted by failed self-proclaimed physicists. Although it had zero career benefit, to contribute to the public good to prevent the spread of pseudoscience, I spent a few days writing this critique. The paper got desk-rejected from [Physical Review Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/), [Physical Review E](https://journals.aps.org/pre/), and [Chaos](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha) and became dormant. After my pleasant experience at [Qeios](https://www.qeios.com/), I published the paper there.
