After my [2022 ECMA paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA17984) got accepted in January 2022, I got burnt out. I stopped doing research and spent most of my time on tennis. I became a captain of a USTA 7.0 mixed doubles team (I had just become 4.0), and my wife and I recruited strong players, organized practices, and advanced to sectionals twice.

My coauthor [Jim Rauch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rauch) was the recruitment chair when I got hired at UCSD in 2013 and then became the department chair for a few years, so I had a lot of interaction with him. When we chatted in June 2022, he mentioned he was interested in a project to animate the contraction mapping theorem to help build intuition. We knew it had zero career benefit but it sounded fun, so I wrote up some pedagogical material and Jim made the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcm_7AmUvZ0).

We tried to publish this in journals on economic education but we got desk-rejected each time. The paper was dormant for a while. Then I was asked to review a paper at [Qeios](https://www.qeios.com/). Because I had never heard of it, I thought it was a predatory journal, but upon inspection its business model seemed interesting: they publish any paper, but reviews are open and (to prevent abuse) reviewers write reviews with their real names. So we posted our paper there, and we are happy that our paper and video were well received.
